          <p>â€¢ All content manipulated in the frontend views is <strong>reflected in the MongoDB database</strong> in real time.</p>
          <p>â€¢ <strong>CRUD operations</strong> are implemented for all major features (Users, Rooms, Bookings).</p>
          <p>â€¢ At least <strong>5 sample data entries</strong> exist for each applicable feature (users, rooms, bookings).</p>
